Vesper
======

## Overview

Vesper is open source software for acoustic monitoring of nocturnal bird
migration.

Vesper aims to enable a wide range of users, including both bird enthusiasts
and professional ornithologists, to collaboratively collect, view, and
analyze nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) of migratory birds at a wide range of
project scales.

Vesper is a web application. As such, it comprises two parts, a
*server* and a *client*. The server stores and processes audio data
and metadata while the client runs in a web browser to provide the
user interface. The server and client can run on the same computer
for personal or small group use, or the server can run on a separate
computer and serve multiple clients for larger deployments.

## Installation
Vesper is not yet ready for widespread use, but for the intrepid
there are preliminary
[installation instructions](https://vesper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
