'''
Design of Vesper audio file signals:

* Support various audio file formats through plugins.

* WaveFileSignal plugin supports WAVE files via the Python `wave` module.

* AiffFileSignal plugin supports AIFF files via the Python `aifc` module.

* Optional SoundFileSignal plugin supports various kinds of audio files
  via the SoundFile package. I would like for this plugin to be optional
  in the sense that if you won't use it you don't have to install the
  SoundFile package and its dependencies.

* Audio file signal class initializer accepts a file path or a file-like
  object. Raises an `UnsupportedAudioFileError` if the file is not supported.
