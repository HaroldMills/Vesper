General points about signals:

* Indexing a `Signal` or a `MultichannelSignal` yields a scalar sample
or a NumPy array of samples. To the extent possible, indexing a
`Signal` or a `MultichannelSignal` should behave just like indexing
a NumPy array with the same shape.

* With the preceding point in mind, I have chosen not to allow the use
of negative signal indices to index signal samples to the left of the
origin. The use of negative signal indices is common in the field of
signal processing, but in Python and NumPy negative indices are used
to index a sequence relative to its end. The `Signal` and
`MultichannelSignal` classes support the Pythonic use of negative
indices for all signal axes.


Signal

* Sequence of n-dimensional sample arrays.
* All sample arrays of a signal have the same dimensions.
* Indexing yields NumPy array of samples.
* First index is for time axis.
* Other indices are for sample array axes.
* Time axis has a nonnegative start index and a nonnegative length.
* Reading outside of extent returns zeros.
* Three levels of mutability: immutable, extendible, and editable.
* Need thread synchronization for mutable signals.

s[0, 10:-20]             # part of sample array 0


MultichannelSignal.

* Sequence of channels, each a `Signal`.
* All channels share start index, length, and sample array dimensions.
* Sequence of sample arrays at a given signal index is a *sample frame*.
* Indexing yields NumPy array of samples.
* First index is channel number.
* Second index is for time axis.
* Other indices are for sample array axes.
* Each channel has its own amplitude axis.

s.name

s.channels               # `NamedSequence` of `Signal` objects

s.time_axis              # `TimeAxis`
s.array_axes             # `NamedSequence` of `ArrayAxis` objects

len(s)                   # number of channels

s[:]                     # all samples of all channels
s[0]                     # all samples of channel 0
s[0, 10]                 # sample array 10 of channel 0

s[:, 10]                 # sample frame 10
s[:, 10:20]              # sample frames 10 through 19


Axis

a.name                   # e.g. 'Time', 'Frequency'
a.units                  # `Bunch` with `plural`, `singular`, and
                         # `abbreviation` attributes


IndexedAxis(Axis)

Note the asymmetry between the start index and end index: the start index
is always a nonnegative integer, while the end index is either a
nonnegative integer or `None`. This is intentional, and reflects the
fact that the start index and the length of an axis determine the
extent of the axis, while the end index is simply a derived
quantity provided for convenience. For mutable signals that grow from
nothing, we want to be able to specify an integer start index (typically
zero) and a zero length for the time axis at initialization, and then
increase the length while leaving the start index alone as the signal
grows. It would be undesirable to set the start index to an integer in
the initializer, only to have it read `None` because the
length was zero, and then magically attain the value passed to the
initializer when the signal length became nonzero. It would also be
undesirable to not be able to initialize the start index to a
non-`None` value when the length is zero, and to have to set it to
the desired non-`None` value later when the length became nonzero.

a.start_index            # start of index range
a.end_index              # end of index range, `None` if length zero
a.length                 # axis length in indices


TimeAxis(IndexedAxis)

Axis values have units of seconds. A `TimeAxis` may be *date/time calibrated*,
in which case the date and time of each sample are known.

Note the asymmetries between the start time and the end time and the
start datetime and end datetime. These follow from the asymmetry
between the start index and the end index.

a.sample_rate            # hertz
a.sample_period          # seconds (same as `index_step_size`)

a.index_to_time_mapping
a.index_to_time(i)       # indices may be float
a.time_to_index(t)       # indices are float

a.start_time             # time at start index
a.end_time               # time at end index, `None` if length zero
a.span                   # end time less start time, `None` if length zero
a.duration               # span plus sample period, zero if length zero

a.reference_datetime     # `Bunch` with `index` and `datetime` attributes
a.index_to_datetime(i)   # indices may be float
a.datetime_to_index(dt)  # indices are float

a.start_datetime         # `datetime` at start index, `None` if unknown
a.end_datetime           # `datetime` at start index, `None` if unknown


ArrayAxis(IndexedAxis)

a.index_to_value_mapping
a.index_to_value(i)      # indices may be float
a.value_to_index(v)      # indices are float

a.start_value            # value at start index
a.end_value              # value at end index, `None` if length zero
a.span                   # end value less start value, `None` if length zero


AmplitudeAxis(Axis)

For now, `AmplitudeAxis` is just a subclass of `Axis` with a specialized
initializer and no other methods. It will (probably) eventually provide
amplitude calibration functionality.


* How do we support mutable signals? The two types of mutable signals
  I can think of are *extensible* signals and *editable* signals. The
  available extent of an extensible signal can change, but the sample
  values (i.e. the values of the samples of any particular sample array)
  of the signal never change. Both the available extent and the sample
  values of an editable signal can change via cut and paste operations.
  [Why have two classes of mutable signals? Why not have just editable
  signals (though we might just call them mutable), which subsume
  extendible signals?]
  
  Mutability complicates signal processing. I have in mind implementing
  signal processing lazily inside various `Signal` subclasses. For
  example, I would like to implement a `Spectrogram` subclass, an
  instance of which computes a spectrogram of a wrapped waveform.
  To support mutability, I have in mind making `Signal` instances
  observable. Then a `Signal` that wraps another signal can observe
  that signal, so that whenever the latter changes the former can
  notify its observers of how it, in turn, has changed. The
  notifications would include an indication of where along the time
  axis the changes occurred.
  
  [Some signal processors might two or more output signals. For
  example, a spectrograph might offer complex, magnitude, and
  phase output signals. In this case the spectrograph would not
  itself be a `Signal` or a `MultichannelSignal`, but would be
  some other type of object (a `SignalProcessor`, perhaps) that
  would offer several output signals, and that might tailor its
  computation to which of those outputs are being observed. If
  only the magnitude output of a spectrograph is being observed,
  for example, it might use the SciPy `spectrogram` function
  differently (in particular, to compute only the spectrogram
  magnitude) than it would if its complex output was being
  observed.
  
  We will also have to concern ourselves with thread synchronization
  for mutable signals. We might just use locks for this, perhaps in
  conjunction with Python's `with` statement.
  
  It seems to me that it might be good for the signal classes to
  explicitly acknowledge the difference between real-time signals,
  for which change is steady and predictable and places certain
  constraints on processing, and editable signals, for which change
  is less predictable but doesn't constrain processing as heavily.
  The two cases are really quite different.
