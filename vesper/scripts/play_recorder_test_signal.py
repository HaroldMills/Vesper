"""
Plays chirps repeatedly forever.

Different chirps can be configured for different channels.

I wrote this script to help test the Vesper recorder. Chirp test signals
should make it relatively easy to spot locations of dropped sample buffers
in test recording spectrograms.

The script allocates a fixed amount of sample memory before starting playback,
and does not allocate any sample memory during playback, including in the
PyAudio callback function.

In order to keep computation performed on the callback thread as simple as
possible, a separate thread called the *player thread* fills sample buffers
from precomputed chirps and feeds them to the callback thread via a queue
called the *filled buffer queue*. When it is done with a buffer, the callback
returns it to the player thread via a second queue called the
*free buffer queue*. The number of buffers is fixed, and the player thread
fills all of the buffers and writes them to the filled buffer queue before
starting the PyAudio output stream.

To create a Conda environment in which to run this script:

    conda create -n play-recorder-test-signal python=3.9
    conda activate play-recorder-test-signal
    conda install pyaudio
    pip install numpy ruamel_yaml

As of 2024-01-11, the script raises a SystemError exception for Python
3.10 and above, with the message:

    SystemError: PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN macro must be defined for '#' formats

The problem appears to be with pyaudio: see
