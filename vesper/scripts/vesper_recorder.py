"""
Script version of the Vesper Recorder.

The script takes no arguments.

The Vesper Recorder requires a home directory whose location is specified
by the `VESPER_RECORDER_HOME` environment variable. The home directory
must contain a YAML configuration file named `Vesper Recorder Config.yaml`.
An example configuration file including extensive comments is distributed
with the recorder.

The recorder logs messages to the file `Vesper Recorder Log.txt`, also in
the recorder home directory. This script also logs essentially the same
messages to the console.

To create a conda environment in which to run the Vesper Recorder:

    conda create -n vesper_recorder python
    conda activate vesper_recorder
    conda install pyaudio
    pip install jsonschema pyephem ruamel.yaml
    
To run the Vesper Recorder, you must have the PYTHONPATH and
VESPER_RECORDER_HOME environment variables set. On Unix, for example:

    export PYTHONPATH="/Users/Harold/Documents/Code/Python/Vesper/vesper"
    export VESPER_RECORDER_HOME="/Users/Harold/Desktop/Vesper Recorder"
    
Then, in an Anaconda Prompt or terminal window, run the Vesper Recorder
script:

    conda activate vesper_recorder
    python -m vesper.scripts.vesper_recorder
