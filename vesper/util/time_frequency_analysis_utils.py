'''
TODO: Reconsider time frequency analysis terminology. I think it
might be good, for example, to use the term "record" (or maybe something
else, e.g. "vector", though "record" is my favorite at the moment) to
refer to a vector of samples that is analyzed, say by applying a window
and then computing a DFT. The first step of the analyses we intend to
support is always to generate a sequence of uniformly-sized sample
vectors from a continuous sample sequence, with each vector to be
analyzed subsequently in the same way, and it seems like it would be
a good idea to have a name for each of the vectors.
