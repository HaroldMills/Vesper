"""
Functions pertaining to audio files.

For the time being, this module supports only one-channel and two-channel
16-bit WAVE files. It includes support for incremental writes that open a
file, append samples to it, and close it. Python's `wave` module does not
seem to support incremental writes, which is desirable for recording.

It would be good to add support for reading and writing a wide variety of
audio files via a library like PySoundFile, even if we don't support
incremental writes for all formats. It would also be good to be able to
write 24-bit and 32-bit WAVE files, multichannel WAVE files, AIFF files,
and perhaps FLAC files incrementally.
