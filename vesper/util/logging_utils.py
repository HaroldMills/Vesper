# TODO: Include logging Python module names in log messages, and make
# log messages easier to parse into parts. The following is a possibility.
# We put the time of a log message first for sorting purposes. We put the
# message text last so a log line can be split into its parts relatively
# easily, even if the text happens to contain one or more separators. We
# put the level name just before the message since that reads nicely.
# Note that to get Python module names into log messages, we will have
# to modify not only this module but all of the places where other
# modules get their loggers. They currently get the root logger instead
# of a module-specific one.

#     '%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d', '%(name)s', '%(levelname)s', '%(message)s'))
