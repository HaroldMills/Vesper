# TODO: Consider how much of a problem it is to define solar noon and
# midnight in terms of meridian and antimeridian transits instead of
# altitude extrema. The two are close (how close?) but not identical
# (see https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/almanac.html#transits for more).
# Defining solar noon and midnight in terms of transits can cause
# certain problems in rare (how rare?) circumstances, such as an
# astronomical dawn for a day that slightly precedes the midnight that
# starts that day. We could avoid such problems by defining solar noon
# and midnight in terms of altitude extrema instead of transits. That
# would be more expensive (how much?) computationally, however. Is it
# worth the expense to avoid rare oddities?

# TODO: Make time zone optional. When absent, return only UTC times
# from methods, raising an exception if local result times are
# indicated to the initializer, and use a UTC-offset time zone
# internally when a time zone is required for computations. Compute
# the UTC offset from the longitude, assuming that the 180th
# meridian is the international date line. That will work for most
# locations on the earth, except those where the actual date differs
# from what it would be if the 180th meridian were the international
# date line.

Omit the following methods initially. Skyfield does not yet offer
moonrise and moonset calculations. It is more difficult to calculate
rise and set events for the moon than the sun because of the nearness
of the moon to the earth and the eccentricity of the moon's orbit.
These make the angle subtended by the moon more variable than the
angle subtended by the sun.

class SunMoon:
    
    """
    Solar and lunar astronomical calculator for a single location.
    
    A `SunMoon` calculates various quantities related to the observation
    of the sun and the moon from a particular location on the earth. The
    quantities include the positions of the sun and moon in the sky, the
    times of solar events (like sunrise and sunset) defined in terms of
    the altitude of the sun, and the illuminated fraction of the moon.
    
    A `SunMoon` performs all computations for an observer at sea level,
    since quantities computed at other (realistic, terrestrial) elevations
    seem to differ only very slightly from those. For example, sunrise
    times for observers at sea level and an elevation of 10,000 meters
    (i.e. higher than the top of Mount Everest) differ by only about a
    millisecond at the latitude and longitude of Ithaca, New York.
    
    The `latitude` and `longitude` initializer arguments specify
    the location for which the `SunMoon` should perform computations.
    They have units of degrees.
    
    The `time_zone` initializer argument specifies the local time zone
    of a `SunMoon`. It can be either a string IANA time zone name (e.g.
    "US/Eastern") or an instance of a `datetime.tzinfo` subclass.
    
    The `result_times_local` initializer argument determines whether
    times returned by the methods of a `SunMoon` are in the local time
    zone or UTC.
    
    The time zone of a `SunMoon` is used for two purposes. First, if
    the `result_times_local` property of the object is `True`, the
    object uses the time zone to make all times returned by its methods
    local.
    
    Second, all `SunMoon` methods that find events for a specified
    date use the time zone to help identify the correct UTC interval
    to search for the events. For most locations, including all those
    a sufficient longitudinal distance from the 180th meridian, the
    the correct interval can be found by a simple algorithm that
    assumes that that meridian is the international date line. The
    international date line is not simply that meridian, however, so
    the algorithm fails in some areas near it. In order to guarantee
    correct results for all locations on earth, we have chosen to
    simply require specification of a time zone for every `SunMoon`
    object.
    
    A future version of this class may make time zones optional for
    `SunMoon` objects that don't need them, i.e. for objects with
    locations for which the algorithm mentioned in the previous
    paragraph works, and that return UTC times instead of local ones.
    
    Methods that have `datetime` arguments require that those arguments
    be time-zone-aware.
    
    Several of the methods of this class cache results to improve the
    efficiency of repeated invocations with the same arguments. These
    methods are:
    
        * get_solar_position
        * get_solar_events
        * _get_solar_transit_events
        * get_solar_event_time

        portion of a solar day during which the sun is either rising or

        six times, after which it concludes that the time is very close
