# The recording_directories setting is a list of the file system
# paths of the recording directories of this archive.
#
# The audio files of the recordings of an archive are stored in one
# or more *recording directories*. Many archives have a single
# recording directory, but an archive can also have multiple
# recording directories, for example if recording files are stored
# on multiple disks.
#
# Each of the specified recording directory paths can be either
# absolute or relative. If it is relative, it must be relative to
# the archive directory. If the setting is omitted, it defaults
# to the "Recordings" subdirectory of the archive directory.
#
# The path of each recording audio file of an archive is stored in
# the archive database as a path relative to the recording directory
# that contains the file. In order to access a file, Vesper must first
# locate the file in one of the recording directories. It does this by
# searching for the file in the recording directories in the order
# specified by this setting. Note that for this to work, the
# relative paths of the recording audio files stored in the archive
# database must be unique. A good practice is to make not only the
# relative file paths but the file names themselves unique, for
# example with each file name including a unique combination of a
# station name and a file start time.
#
# The example setting below has been commented out to disable it.
# To enable the setting, remove the two-character sequence "# "
# (i.e. a pound sign followed by a space) from the beginning of each
# line of the setting, including the "recording_directories" line.
# recording_directories:
#     - 'W:\NFC\Recordings'           # Windows
#     - '/Volumes/NFC/Recordings'     # macOS
