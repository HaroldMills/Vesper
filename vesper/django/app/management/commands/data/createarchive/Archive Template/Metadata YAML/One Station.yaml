# This example metadata YAML file shows how to specify metadata for
# initializing a Vesper archive with one monitoring station. For an
# example of how to specify metadata for the more complicated case
# of an archive with multiple stations, see the accompanying file
# "Two Stations.yaml".
#
# A metadata YAML file specifies metadata to be imported into a Vesper
# archive, either to initialize the archive just after you create it, or
# to add additional metadata to it later. The file uses the YAML text
# file format, which you can read about at
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML.
#
# You can think of a metadata YAML file as comprising one or more
# *sections* with the names:
#
#     stations
#     device_models
#     devices
#     station_devices
#     detectors
#     classifiers
#     annotation_constraints
#     annotations
#
# Which sections are present in a particular metadata YAML file
# depends on the kinds of metadata that the file specifies. For
# example, a file like this one that initializes an archive might
# include all of the sections, while another file that is used
# later to add some new detectors to an archive might include only
# a "detectors" section. Each section can occur at most once in
# any particular file.


# The "stations" section specifies the recording stations of your
# archive. Each station must have a unique name, a time zone, and
# a location. Specify the time zone as a tz database time zone name
# (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
# Specify the latitude and longitude of a station in degrees, and the
# elevation in meters. If you don't know the elevations of your
# stations, don't worry about it: just specify zero. Vesper currently
# makes no use of the elevation, though a future version might use it,
# and it might also be useful for analyzing data that you export from
# Vesper.
#
# A station also includes an associated set of recording devices,
# specifically recorders and microphones. These are specified in the
# "device_models", "devices", and "station_devices" sections, below.
# Vesper uses this information to keep track of which microphone
# was used to record each channel of each recording of your archive.

# The "device_models" section specifies the *models* of recorders and
# microphones used to make the recordings of your archive, but not the
# actual physical devices themselves. The actual physical devices
# are specified in the "devices" section, below. Each device must be
# uniquely identified by its name.

      num_outputs: 1

# The "devices" section specifies the actual physical devices used to make
# the recordings of an archive. Each device must be uniquely identified by
# its name. The value of the "model" item for a device should be the name
# of the appropriate device model in the "device_models" section. Feel
# free to make up serial numbers if you don't know them (you can change
# your made-up serial numbers later if you wish) or if you just don't want
# to track them. Note also that serial numbers can include non-numeric
# characters. For example, "ABC" and "001X2" are valid serial numbers.
#
# The information in the "devices" and  "station_devices" sections
# (the "station_devices" section follows the "devices" section), allows
# Vesper to keep track of changes in the set of devices that you used at
# a given station to make its recordings. Note that you do not have to
# track such changes if you don't want to. For example, you might specify
# a single recorder and microphone for each of your stations in both the
# "devices" and "station_devices" sections, giving the devices made-up
# serial numbers and indicating that those devices were the only ones
# used at your station, even if you sometimes replaced defective devices
# with others of the same model during your recording season.

      description: Microphone used at the station of this archive.

# The "station_devices" section specifies the recording devices used at
# your stations, including the names of the devices, the range of dates
# during which they were used, and how the devices were connected.
#
# A connection is specified as the device output and device input that
# were connected. A device output or input is specified as the combination
# of a device name and an output or input name, respectively. An output or
# input name comprises the word "Output" or "Input" followed by an output
# or input number, beginning with 0. So, for example, the first input of
# a recorder named "Recorder 10" is specified as "Recorder 10 Input 0".
# If a device has only one input or output (which is usually the case for
# a microphone, and often for a recorder), omit the input or output number
# from the input or output name. So, for example, if a microphone with
# name "21c 10" has just one output, specity the output as "21c 10 Output"
# rather than "21c 10 Output 0".

# below are also available, including versions of BirdVoxDetect and the
# MPG Ranch detectors that use other thresholds. A future version of
# Vesper will support detector plug-ins, allowing users and third parties
# to add their own detectors to Vesper without modifying Vesper's source

          manually or automatically. For use in conjunction with the Old

# The "annotation_constraints" section specifies sets of values for
