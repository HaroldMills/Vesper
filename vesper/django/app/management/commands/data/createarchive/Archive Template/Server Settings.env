# Vesper server settings.


# Django web framework secret key. If your Vesper server will be
# visible to the public over the internet, replace the quoted value
# below with a long random string that you keep secret (e.g. don't
# commit the value to a public code repository). This will make it
# more difficult for a malicious actor to compromise the security of
# your server. If your server will not be visible to the public, you
# can use the insecure key below. (That key is insecure because it
# comes with this file, which is publicly available.) This variable
# is required.
SECRET_KEY="rk4bdfstyc!*te=!y8gf58t7kdd5$$5l+v6e&y%-&in!fl(=ay"

# Set this "True" to run the Django web framework in debug mode.
# This provides more detailed error messages that are useful for
# debugging during development. Always set it `False` for production,
# since there is information in the more detailed error messages that
# malicious actors might be able to exploit to compromise the security
# of your site. This variable is optional, and defaults to "False".
DEBUG=True

# The path of the directory of the archive to serve. It's almost always
# either a good idea or harmless to put the list in single quotes, so
# we recommend doing that unless you know you shouldn't. This variable
# is optional, and default to the current working directory, i.e. the
# directory in which the server started.
# VESPER_ARCHIVE_DIR_PATH='/Users/Nora/Desktop/Vesper Archives/2022'

# The URL of the archive database. See the "URL schema" table at
# https://github.com/jazzband/dj-database-url for the form the URL
# should take for different database engines (e.g. PostgreSQL and
# SQLite). This variable is optional, and defaults to the URL of
# the SQLite database file "Archive Database.sqlite" in the archive
# directory.
# VESPER_ARCHIVE_DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./Archive Database.sqlite"

# List of comma-separated recording directory paths, or just a single
# path if there's only one. It's almost always either a good idea or
# harmless to put the list in single quotes, so we recommend doing
# that unless you know you shouldn't. This variable is optional, and
# defaults to the "Recordings" directory of the archive directory.
# VESPER_RECORDING_DIR_PATHS='/Volumes/Recordings/2022'

# Whether or not the archive is read-only. Set this "True" to omit UI
# and URLs that support archive modification, including Django admin
# and login views. This variable is optional, and defaults to "True".
VESPER_ARCHIVE_READ_ONLY=False
