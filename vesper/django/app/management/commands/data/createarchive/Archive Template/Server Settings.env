# Vesper server settings.


# Django web framework secret key. If your Vesper server will be
# visible to the public over the internet, replace the quoted value
# below with a long random string that you keep secret (e.g. don't
# commit the value to a public code repository). This will make it
# more difficult for malicious actors to compromise the security of
# your server. If your server will not be visible to the public, you
# can use the insecure key below. (The key below is insecure since
# this file is publicly available.) Setting this variable is required.
SECRET_KEY="rk4bdfstyc!*te=!y8gf58t7kdd5$$5l+v6e&y%-&in!fl(=ay"

# Set this "True" to run the Django web framework in debug mode.
# This provides more detailed error messages that are useful for
# debugging during development. Always set it `False` for production,
# since there is information in the more detailed error messages that
# malicious actors might be able to exploit to compromise the security
# of your site. Setting this variable is optional: its value defaults
# to "False".
DEBUG=True

# The URL of the archive database. See the "URL schema" table at
# https://github.com/jazzband/dj-database-url for the form the URL
# should take for different database engines (e.g. PostgreSQL and
# SQLite). Setting this variable is required.
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./Archive Database.sqlite"

# Set this "True" to omit UI and URLs that support archive modification,
# including Django admin and login views. Setting this variable is
# optional: its value defaults to "True".
VESPER_ARCHIVE_READ_ONLY=False

# The path of the directory of the archive to serve. It's almost always
# either a good idea or harmless to put the list in single quotes, so
# we recommend doing that unless you know you shouldn't. Setting this
# variable is optional. The archive directory defaults to the current
# working directory of the server, which is usually the directory from
# which you issue the command to start it.
# VESPER_ARCHIVE_DIR_PATH='/Users/Nora/Desktop/Vesper Archives/2022'

# List of comma-separated recording directory paths, or just a single
# path if there's only one. It's almost always either a good idea or
# harmless to put the list in single quotes, so we recommend doing
# that unless you know you shouldn't. Setting this variable is
# optional: the recording directory defaults to the "Recordings"
# directory of the archive directory.
# VESPER_RECORDING_DIR_PATHS='/Volumes/Recordings/2022'
