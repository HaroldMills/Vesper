# There are two basic ways to specify the time intervals of exported
# clips. This preset demonstrates one of the ways, which involves
# duration, alignment, and offset settings. If you specify a duration,
# you're using this form of specification, and if you don't you're
# using the other. See the other preset that accompanies this one for
# an example of the other form.

time_interval:

    # Exported clip duration, in seconds.
    duration: 3 

    # Alignment of archive clip within exported clip, either "Center",
    # "Left", or "Right". This setting is optional and defaults to "Center".
    alignment: Center

    # Offset of archive clip in exported clip relative to where it would
    # be given duration and alignment alone, in seconds. This setting is
    # optional and defaults to zero.
    offset: -.1
