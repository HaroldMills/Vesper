# Vesper server environment variables.
#
# Use this file to set environment variables for running the Vesper
# server outside of a Docker container. You probably don't want to
# do that (i.e. you can ignore this file) unless you are a developer,
# and even then it's usually best to run the server in a container,
# since that's how users run it.
#
# Do not use this file to set environment variables for running the
# Vesper server in a Docker container. Use the appropriate Docker
# Compose compose.yaml file for that.


# Django web framework secret key. If your Vesper server will be
# visible to the public over the internet, replace the quoted value
# below with a long random string that you keep secret (e.g. don't
# commit the value to a public code repository). This will make it
# more difficult for a malicious actor to compromise the security of
# your server. If your server will not be visible to the public, you
# can use the insecure key below. (That key is insecure because it
# comes with this file, which is publicly available.) This variable
# is required.

# Set this "true" to run the Django web framework in debug mode.
# This provides more detailed error messages that are useful for
# debugging during development. Always set it "false" for production,
# since there is information in the more detailed error messages that
# malicious actors might be able to exploit to compromise the security
# of your site. This variable is optional, and defaults to "false".

# The path of the directory of the archive to serve. It's almost always
# either a good idea or harmless to put the list in single quotes, so
# we recommend doing that unless you know you shouldn't. This variable
# is optional, and default to the current working directory, i.e. the
# directory in which the server started.
VESPER_ARCHIVE_DIR_PATH='/Users/harold/Desktop/NFC/Data/Harold/2022 Harold Archive'

# List of comma-separated recording directory paths, or just a single
# path if there's only one. It's almost always either a good idea or
# harmless to put the list in single quotes, so we recommend doing
