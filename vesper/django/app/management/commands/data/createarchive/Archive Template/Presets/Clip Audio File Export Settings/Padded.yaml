# There are two basic ways to specify the time intervals of exported
# clips. This preset demonstrates one of the ways, which involves
# "left_padding", "right_padding", and "offset" settings. See the
# other preset that accompanies this one for an example of the other
# form.
#
# Note that if a preset specifies left and/or right padding, it
# usually does not also specify an offset. That's because such an
# offset could just be added to the left padding and subtracted
# from the right padding and then omitted. Another way of saying
# this is that when a preset of this form specifies an offset, it
# usually specifies that offset alone.

time_interval:

    # Left padding added to the archive clip in the exported clip, in
    # seconds. This setting is optional and defaults to zero. It is
    # usually positive when specified, but can also be negative to omit
    # a leading segment of the archive clip in the exported clip.
    left_padding: .6

    # Right padding added to the archive clip in the exported clip, in
    # seconds. This setting is optional and defaults to zero. It is
    # usually positive when specified, but can also be negative to omit
    # a trailing segment of the archive clip in the exported clip.
    right_padding: .5

    # Offset of archive clip in exported clip relative to where it
    # would be given left and right padding alone (including if they
    # are omitted and hence zero), in seconds. This setting is optional
    # and defaults to zero.
    offset: .1
