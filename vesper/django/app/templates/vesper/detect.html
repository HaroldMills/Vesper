    <h2>Detect</h2>

    <p>
        Runs one or more detectors on all channels of the specified recordings.
    </p>
    
    {% include "vesper/recordings-specification-message.html" %}
    
    <p>
        The time intervals on which the detectors are run can optionally be
        limited via by selecting a <code>Detection Schedule</code> preset in
        the <code>Schedule</code> field. If a schedule is selected, detectors
        are run only on time intervals in the intersection of the recording
        intervals and the schedule intervals.

<!--    
    <p>
        Check the <code>Create clip audio files</code> check box to create
        a separate audio file in the archive for each detected clip, or
        uncheck it to rely on on-the-fly clip extraction from recording
        audio files to access clip samples.
    </p>
-->
    <p>
        Check the <code>Defer clip creation</code> check box to defer
        clip creation to the next invocation of the
        <code>Execute Deferred Actions</code> command.
    </p>

<!--
    <p>
        Check the <code>Defer clip creation</code> check box to defer
        clip creation to a later time. When the box is unchecked, this
        command creates clips in the archive database as it runs. When
        the box is checked, the command does not write any clips to the
        database, but rather writes clip metadata to one or more
        temporary files located in the <code>Deferred Actions</code>
        subdirectory of the archive directory. You can then create the
        clips in the database later by running the
        <code>Execute Deferred Actions</code> command.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you run only one Vesper job at a time, and do not view clip
        albums while your jobs are running, you can safely leave the
        <code>Defer clip creation</code> check box unchecked, and will
        never need to run the <code>Execute Deferred Actions</code>
        command. If your archive uses the SQLite database (the default),
        however, and you wish to run multiple detection and/or
        classification jobs simultaneously, and/or view clip albums
        while one or more such jobs are running, you should check the
        <code>Defer clip creation</code> check box.
    </p>
     
    <p>
        You can run the <code>Execute Deferred Actions</code> command
        just once to create clips deferred from multiple detection jobs.
        For example, you can run two or more detection jobs
        simultaneously, deferring clip creation, and then run the
        <code>Execute Deferred Actions</code> command once to create
        the clips from both jobs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Deferred clip creation is offered as a workaround to a
        limitation of the SQLite database, which provides only limited
        support for concurrent database access. If you run, say, two
        detection jobs simultaneously and do not defer clip creation,
        the two jobs may try to write to the database concurrently,
        and if their use of the database is sufficiently heavy this
        can cause database errors in the form of database lock timeouts.
