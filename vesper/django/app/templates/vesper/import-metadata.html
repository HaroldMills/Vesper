    <h2>Import metadata</h2>

    <p>
        Imports the specified metadata into this Vesper archive.
    </p>
    <p>
        The metadata must be YAML text. The text can describe stations,
        devices (such as microphones and recorders), which devices were
        used at which stations during which time periods, and how the
        devices were connected (for example, which microphones were
        connected to which recorder channels). It can also processors
        and annotations.
        [Need to describe metadata YAML format in more detail, perhaps
        on another page that we link to here.]
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you can drag and drop a YAML file to the text area below
        to set the contents of the text area to the contents of the file.
