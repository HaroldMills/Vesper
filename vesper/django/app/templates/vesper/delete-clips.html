        All data associated with the clips, including their audio
        files and annotations, are deleted. You can optionally specify a
        number of clips to retain. The retained clips are selected at random
        from those specified, with all clips equally likely to be retained.

        This command can delete a lot of clips and annotations, and cannot
        be undone, so use it with caution!
