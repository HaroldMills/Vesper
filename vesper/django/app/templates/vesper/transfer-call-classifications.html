    <h2>Transfer call classifications</h2>

    <p>
        Transfers <code>Call*</code> classifications from clips of one
        detector to corresponding clips of another detector.
    </p>
    <p>
        The detector from whose clips classifications are transferred is
        called the <i>source</i> detector and the detector to whose clips
        the classifications are transferred is called the <i>target</i>
        detector. The set of source detector call clips from which to
        transfer classifications is specified as a detector, a set of
        station/mic pairs, and a range of dates. For each of the specified
        source detector clips, the command attempts to find a target
        detector clip that starts at a similar time. If such a clip is
        found, the command transfers the source detector clip's
        classification to it. The source detector clip retains its
        classification (i.e. we use the term "transfer" a little loosely
        here).
