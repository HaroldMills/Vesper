The Bootstrap code and fonts in this directory were downloaded on
2021-05-12 from https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.6/docs/getting-started/
by clicking on the "Download Boostrap" button near the top of the
page. I deleted from the distribution several CSS and JavaScript
files that were not needed, retaining only the minified ones. I
retained all of the font files.

I added the boostrap.min.css.map file on 2021-06-22 since Chrome
was complaining that it was missing.
