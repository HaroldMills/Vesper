_MIN_CLIP_FILE_PROCESSING_DELAY = 5
"""
The minimum number of seconds that must have elapsed since a clip file
created by an Old Bird detector program was last modified before the
detector monitor will attempt to process it. We impose this wait because
we have found that if we don't, the detector monitor will sometimes try
to process a clip file before the detector program has finished writing
it, resulting in an error. An example of the error message logged by the
detector monitor when this happens is:

    2016-09-13 09:17:44,832 ERROR    Could not read .wav file
        "C:\temp\calls\Tseep_000.02.10_00.wav". Error message was:
        total size of new array must be unchanged
        
The above error message was logged when the minimum processing delay was
set to one second, so I increased it to five seconds. This will not
entirely eliminate the chance that an error will occur, but it should
reduce it substantially.
"""

_CLIP_SEARCH_PADDING = 2
"""
Padding for recording clip search, in seconds.

Since the Old Bird detectors only provide an approximate start time
of a clip in a recording (as an integer number of seconds from the
start of the recording), to find the exact index of a clip in a
recording we must search for the clip in the recording. We do this
by searching for the clip in the portion of the recording that starts
`_CLIP_SEARCH_PADDING` seconds before the approximate clip start time
and whose duration is the clip duration plus twice the padding.

class OldBirdDetectorRunner:

    Runs the Old Bird Tseep and/or Thrush detectors on archived recordings.
    
    The `run_detectors` method of this class runs the Old Bird Tseep
    and/or Thrush detectors on a single channel of a single recording
    file. The method can only run on Windows, since the Old Bird detectors
    are Windows programs.
    
    Each of the Old Bird detector programs runs in its own process.
    For each running detector program, a *detector monitor* runs on its
    own thread in the main job process, monitoring the status of the
    detector and archiving clips according to the clip files it creates.
    
    Note that due to a limitation of the Old Bird detector programs, all
    detector programs that run simultaneously must run on the same recording
    file and channel. We do not attempt to enforce this, however. The user
    must refrain from running more than one detection job simultaneously.

        The `detectors` and `recording_file` arguments are Django
        `Processor` and `RecordingFile` model instances. The detectors
        that are run are the Old Bird Tseep-x and/or Thrush-x Windows
        executables, and each detector runs in its own process. Each
        detector process is started by a *detector monitor* that runs
        on its own thread in the same process as the `run_detectors`
        method. After starting its detector, a detector monitor checks
        periodically for clip files output by the detector, creates
        a clip in the archive for each file found, and then deletes
        the file. The detector monitor also reads the detector's log
        file periodically, and terminates the detector process when
        the log file indicates that detection is complete.
